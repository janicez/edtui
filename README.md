#### Overview
`EdTUI` is a text editor widget for the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) ecosystem.
It is designed to provide a light-weight user experience inspired by Vim.

Instantiate the state and render the view:
```rust
use edtui::{EditorEventHandler, EditorState, EditorTheme, EditorView};
use ratatui::widgets::Widget;

let mut state = EditorState::default();
EditorView::new(&mut state)
        .theme(EditorTheme::default())
        .wrap(true) // line wrapping
        .render(area, buf);

```

Handle events:
```rust
let mut event_handler = EditorEventHandler::default();

// or handle only key events
event_handler.on_key_event(key_event, &mut state);

// has experimental support for mouse events
event_handler.on_mouse_event(mouse_event, &mut state);

// handles both key and mouse events
event_handler.on_event(event, &mut state);
```

### Features
- Vim-like keybindings and editing modes for efficient text manipulation.
- Copy paste using the systems clipboard.
- Line wrapping.
- Syntax highlighting (experimental).
- Mouse support (experimental).

### Experimental Mouse Support

`Edtui` includes experimental mouse support:
```rust
let event_handler = EditorEvent::default();
event_handler.on_mouse_event(mouse_event, &mut state);
```

**Note**: This feature is experimental, so expect potential bugs and breaking changes. It does
currently not work correctly on wrapped lines.

### Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting was added in version `0.8.4`. It is experimental, so expect breaking changes.

`Edtui` offers a number of custom themes, see [`SyntaxHighlighter::theme`] for a complete list.
If you want to use a custom theme, see [`SyntaxHighlighter::custom_theme`]. Check [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect)
for more details about themes and extensions.

```rust
use edtui::EditorState;
use edtui::EditorView;
use edtui::SyntaxHighlighter;

let theme_name = "dracula";
let extension = "rs";
let syntax_highlighter = SyntaxHighlighter::new(theme_name, extension);
EditorView::new(&mut EditorState::default())
        .syntax_highlighter(Some(syntax_highlighter))
        .render(area, buf);
```
